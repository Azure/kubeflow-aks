---

Start by checking out the [prerequisites]({{< ref "/docs/Deployment Options/prerequisites" >}}) page

If you want to deploy Kubeflow with minimal changes on AKS, then consider the [vanilla]({{< ref "/docs/Deployment Options/vanilla-installation" >}}) deployment option. The Kubeflow control plane is installed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which is a managed container service used to run and scale Kubernetes applications in the cloud.

For a more secure deployment option that is has minimum baseline security, then consider the [deploy with custom password and TLS]({{< ref "/docs/Deployment Options/custom-password-tls" >}}) deployment option.
