# Kubeflow on Azure Kubernetes Service

The Kubeflow project is dedicated to making deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. Our goal is not to recreate other services, but to provide a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for ML on Azure Kubernetes Services.

## Getting Started

There are a number of deployment options for running Kubeflow on AKS. To get started with deploying Kubeflow on [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes), see the [deployment options section](https://azure.github.io/kubeflow-aks/main/docs/deployment-options/) on the [Kubeflow on AKS](https://azure.github.io/kubeflow-aks/main) website.
